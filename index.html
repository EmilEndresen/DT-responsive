         <h2>Absolute units</h2>
         <p>
            Absolute are units that are fixed, examples of absolute units are:
            px, cm, mm, in, pc, pt. <br />
         </p>

      <div>
         <h2>EM and REM</h2>
         <p>
            The EM unit is a relative unit assigned depending on the font size
            of the parent element. <br />
            So if the font size of the element is 20px, 1em would be 20px, and
            2em would be 40px
         </p>
         <button>The Em unit</button>
         <p class="responsive">
            The REM unit is similar to the EM unit, but in difference from EM it
            is relative to the font size of the root element
         </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ch">
         <h2>The CH unit</h2>
         <p>
            The ch unit is equal to the width of the curront font's 0, so 17ch
            would be equal to 17 zeros <br />
            00000000000000000
         </p>

            The ch unit is equal to the width of the curront font's 0, so 17ch
            would be equal to 17 zeros <br />
